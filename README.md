### Part 1

**Completed - July 2, 2021**

- Part 1 included the completion of a top 6 pokemon party page.
- A home page was also set with a brief description of the app.
- An about page was also formed.
- Next Steps:
  - Add a Pokemon Box page that allows for users to update Marty's top 6.

### Part 2 and 3

**Completed - July 5-6, 2021**

- Part 2 and 3 included the model and form to add a new pokemon, the details page as well as the update and delete functionality.
- The former Top 6 party page has been modified to a pokemon box page that includes all pokemon.
- Another Current Team page was included and this site is populated with pokemon if the pokemon's team boolean is true.
- Updated styling as well.

### Part 4 and 5

**Completed - July 7, 2021**

- Part 4 included implementing a one-to-many model for held item (e.g. X-Attack). One pokemon can hold a single item, but that item can be held by many pokemon in the heat of battle.

- I also included a many-to-many model as pokemon can have multiple attacks and these attacks can be shared by many pokemon. For example, Raichu and Starmie can both use Thunder Bolt in the original cannon and yet Starmie can also have attacks like Surf and Swift.

### Part 6

**Completed - July 8, 2021**

- The authentication (user login) is complete. A user can login and add their own pokemon, item and attack. They can build their team and assemble perfect roster ready for battle.

### Future Work

- Extract a complete pokedex from a third-party API.
- Add a battle feature along with levels and experience points.
- A new user will only have access to three starters at first and be forced to catch pokemon in the wild to add them to their pokemon box.
- A user will be able to battle pokemon gyms, accumulate badges, battle the Elite Four and become the Pokemon League Champion.
- A pokemon will be able to evolve after reaching certain levels.
